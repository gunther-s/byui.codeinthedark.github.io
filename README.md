This is for a Code In The Dark activity at BYU-Idaho. All editor assets belong to github.com/codeinthedark

--- The rules ---
1) Stay in this editor at all times
2) Do not preview the result of your code
3) No measurement tools
4) Use "in-line" CSS and/or scripts
5) Stop coding when time is up

Good luck, and most important of all, have fun!
